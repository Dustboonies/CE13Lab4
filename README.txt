What the lab is:
In this lab, students had to correctly implement the functions in stack.h in order to build a library which
handled stacks based off the array.  After doing so, students were then required to create an RPN calculator
using the library that they had just created.  I think the most important part about this lab was dealing with
pointers I felt that those were the most challenging to get correct.  After doing the lab, I have a much better
understanding of what pointers are and what the * and & signs do.

Approach:
I approached the lab by first writing down a program structure on a piece of paper and planning all of the checks
I would have to implement into my code so that I wouldn't get confused.  After doing so,  I implemented the stack.h
functions which were quite simple and then I moved onto the RPN calculator.  At first, I just got the basic calculator
working and then I implemented the error checking.  If I was to do this lab again,  I probably would have studied up
more on pointers before starting as I had a few bugs dealing with pointers throughout the lab.  Other than that I
would have approached it the same as I did this time as it was simple to translate my pseudo code from the paper to
real code in mplabx.  I didn't work with anyone else in the class.

Conclusion:
This lab was much harder than the previous two in my opinion.  Learning and implementing pointers was quite
confusing and took me quite a while to understand.  Implementing stack.h code was relatively simple and didn't
take me too long.  Implementing the RPN calculator wasn't too difficult but did take me a while to do.  This lab
took me around 8 hours in total as I had to do much reading up on pointers as well as the different functions in
string.h.  I liked the algorithmic side of this lab as it took me a while to understand the RPN calculator and
that was quite interesting.  I disliked having to learn about pointers as it was frustrating with all of the bugs
but I think it was necessary and a good addition to the lab.  I think this lab was definitely worthwhile as I
now better understand pointers and will be able to use them with more ease in the future.  I would definitely
provide more explanation concerning pointers before this lab as I had to do a lot of reading on my own in order
to understand pointers.  I would distribute the grades differently, putting a larger emphasis on the RPN calculator
as I thought that part was harder.  I believe the lab manual should have included more information concerning
pointers.  The discussions in class were very helpful and helped me clear a lot of ambiguities concerning the lab
structure and pointers.

I also want to say thank you to all of the TA's who have been amazing and very very helpful so far in my CE13
experience.  Great job to all of you, thank you for what you're doing, I really appreciate it and I'm sure that
many others do as well!
